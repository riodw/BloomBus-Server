**OVERVIEW:**

**1. Project Background and Description**  
Create a bus tracking web application that can be used by students to help determine when an upper campus bus will arrive. The web application will be available for computers and mobile devices. The project will take advantage of GPS services on both the student’s devices and modules that will be installed in the busses to provide bus locations on a map and the next bus’s estimated time of arrival.

**2. Project Scope**  
The scope of this project defined as, but not limited to, the prototype objectives listed below. Prototype objectives are expected to be completed by the end of the 2016 Fall Semester. If prototype objectives are completed earlier than projected, we will proceed with the post-prototype objectives.

**3. Prototype Objectives**  
Create and configure GPS boxes.  
Configure and program a web server to display bus GPS information.  
Demonstrate the proof-of-concept prototype.  

**4. Post-Prototype Objectives**  
Test prototype in actual buses and gather addition information.  
Determine if more powerful components are needed for GPS modules.  
Tweak code and program additional features into the web application.  
Write a follow-up report for Software Engineering class to continue project

**5. Deliverables**  
Source code for prototype.
